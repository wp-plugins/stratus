== Installation ==

Here's a quick installation guide on installing Stratus on your Wordpress:

1. Install the Wordpress plugin which adds an admin interface for setting up the player, by searching for **stratus** in _Plugins > Add New_ within your Wordpress admin interface.
2. Once installed, go activate the plugin on the **Plugins** page in your Wordpress admin interface.
3. When activated, click **Settings** on the Stratus plugin listing on the **Plugins** page and define your settings.

From here, you should provide a `JSON` formatting string of options as described in the [customization](http://stratus.sc/#customization) instructions using the provided [options](http://stratus.sc/#options).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I keep Stratus playing even when the page reloads? =

Not currently. Your site would need to be built so that it doesn't reload rather than the player. _However_, we do provide a popup function that users can click to enjoy your tunes while browsing your site.

= How can I make YouTube videos appear below Stratus? =

The trick is adding `?wmode=transparent` to each of your YouTube videos. That will force the YouTube embed to appear below Stratus _as it should_.
